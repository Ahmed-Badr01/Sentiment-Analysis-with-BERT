# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This notebook walks through the fine-tuning of BERT for Sentiment Analysis on a dataset of Amazon reviews. It uses HuggingFace's
Transformers and Pytorch, as well as Pandas for some data preprocessing.

This project was based on [this notebook](https://github.com/curiousily/Getting-Things-Done-with-Pytorch/blob/master/08.sentiment-analysis-with-bert.ipynb), made by [Venelin Valkov](https://www.youtube.com/@venelin_valkov), but I re-wrote most of it and made a number of changes. I updatd the code (original notebook was written about 3 years ago), reformatted the code for additional clarity where possible, changed the used dataset and generally avoided lazy copy/paste quick fixes.

Still, this took time to finish, but I learned a lot.
